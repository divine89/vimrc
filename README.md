#vimrc simple configuration

This is my personal Vim configuration. It is very simple and clear.

Please make backup of your files:

    mkdir ~/VimFilesBackup
    mv -f ~/.vimrc ~/.vim ~/VimFilesBackup

To install please do followings:

    cd ~/
    git init
    git remote add https://github.com/divine89/vimrc.git
    git pull origin master
    
##Warning

Those commands will automaticly get all files from repository and put it to your home directory, so your curently .vimrc file and .vim folder will be replaced.
